    "## Constructing paths and input for SeqSigNet\n",
    "\n",
    "For the SeqSigNet models, we use a Signature Window Unit (either the Signature Window Network Unit (SWNU) for SeqSigNet or the Signature Attention Units (SWMHAU) for SeqSigNet-Attention-Encoder and SeqSigNet-Attention-BiLSTM models) to process _units_ of the history. In particular, we take a sliding window across the history to construct smaller snapshots/units of history for which the units are applied. The outputs of the units are fixed length feature representations of the window in history. We will see this in more detail later on to make this a bit clearer!\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, for each data point, we need to construct a path of it's history, and then we take a sliding window where we must define three things:\n",
    "1. `shift`: how many data points to shift the window by as we slide through the history\n",
    "2. `window_size`: the size of the sliding window\n",
    "3. `n`: the number of units\n",
    "\n",
    "After choosing these, this will define the history size that you must have in order for this sliding window to move nicely through the history. The equation for computing this is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "k = \\text{shift} * n + (\\text{window\\_size} - \\text{shift})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular example, this is the history is the path consisting of the SBERT representations of the conversation up to the current utterance/data point. We can then take the sliding window to get the units for each snapshot of shitory. Note that having a shift that is smaller than the window size means there is overlap between the units which we typically do want.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all path construction functionality, we can utilise the `nlpsig` library and in particular the `nlpsig.PrepareData` class. To make this even easier, there are helper functions within the `sig_networks` library: specifically the `obtain_SeqSigNet_input` function from `sig_networks.scripts.seqsignet_functions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this function, we need to pass in:\n",
    "- the `method` for dimension reduction we wish to use (for full options, see `nlpsig.DimReduce`)\n",
    "- the `dimension` to reduce down to\n",
    "- the dataframe, `df`, that contains our data\n",
    "- the column name which defines the grouping of our texts, `id_column`\n",
    "    - For this example, this is the transcript/conversation ID, `id_column=\"transcript_id\"`\n",
    "- the label column `label_column`\n",
    "    - For this example, this is the client talk type, `label_column=\"client_talk_type\"`\n",
    "- the embeddings for each item in the dataframe which we obtained earlier\n",
    "- the `shift`, `window_size`, and `n` to use (see above) \n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, there may be some additional features present that we wish to add in such as any time variables or any other non-textual information. We can pass these into the `features` argument and we also have functionality to either include these features in either the path, the inputs that we concatentate at the end of SWNUNetwork, or both. Here, we will just add some time features to the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that after constructing a `nlpsig.PrepareData` object, it will create some time variables such as:\n",
    "- the `timeline_index` which is simply an ordered index for each grouping given by the `id_column`\n",
    "- (if `datetime` is a column in the dataframe) the `time_encoding` which is the date of the data point as a fraction of the year, e.g. 31/01/2014 at 00:00:00 is 31/365 into the year so will be converted to 2014.0849\n",
    "- (if `datetime` is a column in the dataframe) the `time_encoding_minute` which is the time of the data point (ignoring the date) as a fraction of a minute, e.g. 00:01:30 would be converted to 1.50\n",
    "\n",
    "See `nlpsig.PrepareData` for all options implemented. Note that we could also add any other feature that is present in the dataframe (as long as is numerical - categorical ones could be converted to numerical). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will just use `timeline_index` and `time_encoding_minute` which refers to the index of the current data point within its conversation and the time of the utterance as fraction of a minute. We apply no standardisation to these but standardisation methods are available to be applied via the `standardise_method` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, since in this example, we only want to predict on the client talk type but include the therapist utterances in the history, we can slice the input by passing the indices of interest into the `path_indices` argument:"
