# sig-networks

_sig-networks_ is a package for training and evaluating neural networks for
longitudinal NLP classification tasks.

## Installation

...

## Usage

The library is still under development but it is possible to train and evaluate
several models in a few lines of code.

...

## Pre-commit and linters

To take advantage of `pre-commit`, which will automatically format your code and
run some basic checks before you commit:

```
pip install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit on macOS
pre-commit install  # will install a pre-commit hook into the git repo
```

After doing this, each time you commit, some linters will be applied to format
the codebase. You can also/alternatively run `pre-commit run --all-files` to run
the checks.
